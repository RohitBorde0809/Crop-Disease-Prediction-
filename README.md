# Crop-Disease-Prediction

This project aims to predict crop diseases using machine learning techniques. It leverages image data to identify and classify various crop diseases, helping farmers take timely action to protect their crops.

**Features**

  Predicts crop diseases from images
  
  Supports multiple crop types
  
  Provides detailed disease information and treatment suggestions
  
  User-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing images

**Technologies Used**

  Python for backend processing
  
  TensorFlow and Keras for machine learning models
  
  OpenCV for image processing
  
  Flask for the web interface

**Installation**

  1)Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/Rohit-Borde/Crop-Disease-Prediction.git
  
  2)Navigate to the project directory:
    cd Crop-Disease-Prediction
  
  3)Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  
  4)Set up the dataset:
    Download the dataset from the provided source.
    Place the dataset in the data directory.

  5)Train the model:
    python train.py
  
  6)Run the application:
    python app.py

**Usage**

  Launch the application and use the web interface to upload images of crops.
  The system will analyze the images and provide predictions on the disease, along with treatment suggestions.
